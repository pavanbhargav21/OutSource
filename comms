Subject: Proposal to Exclude Week-Off Data from Average Calculations in RPEM APIs

Background:
Currently, our system captures and stores agent activity data for all employees, regardless of whether the date falls on a working day or a week-off (e.g., Saturday, Sunday, or designated weekly off-days). This includes cases where an employee might log in briefly (e.g., 10 minutes or 1 hour) during their week-off.

When average calculations are performed — whether for a week, month, or custom date range — this week-off data is included in the calculation. As a result:

A small amount of activity on a week-off skews both individual and team averages.

The reported averages may not accurately reflect true working-day performance.


Proposed Change:
For all APIs that calculate averages in RPEM, we propose excluding week-off employee activity from the average computation. This means:

If a date is a week-off for a given employee, their data for that date will be ignored in average calculations.

Averages will be calculated only on valid working days for each employee.


Expected Benefits:

More accurate and meaningful average metrics for individuals and teams.

Avoids distortion of averages caused by minimal week-off activity.

Consistency across all APIs, regardless of the selected time period filter (week, month, or custom).


Scope:

Changes will be implemented in all RPEM APIs that involve average calculations.

The logic to exclude week-off data will be applied at the calculation stage.


Request:
We seek sign-off on this proposal so that development can proceed with updating all relevant APIs to exclude week-off data from average computations.

Do you want me to also add a visual example showing how averages change before vs. after this change? That would make the proposal even easier to approve.
